	Prune the search tree by searching from both the front and back.
	* findpath.py (find_path): Extend both the trust and the target
	sets, in an attempt to prune the search tree.
	* pathdb.py (extend_trust): New function.

	A first, crude version of the search algorithm, that only works on
	keys already present in the database.
	* sqltypes.sed: Define "keytype" as an alias for uint32.
	* pathdb.py (type_conv): New constant.  We need to convert LONG as
	long, not int, since we store the key id:s as unsigned values.
	(init): Pass a conv argument to connect.
	(_insert_key): Handle unsigned keys, and keys with no uids,
	properly.  This is needed to handle nonexisting keys.
	(initial_setup): New function.
	(best_match_found): New function.
	(extend_target): New function.
	* keyfetcher.py (toploop): Some debugging removed.  Report each
	key fetch, and failure to fetch a key.
	* findpath.py (find_path): This now basically works, but only if
	all keys are already present in the database.  Vast heuristical
	improvements on the algorithm are possible.
	(print_path): New function.
	* createdb.sql: Use "keytype" as the type for key ids.  They
	should be uint32, never uint64.  Use uint32 instead of uint64 for
	several fields.
	(task_trusted.distance): Added an index on this field.
	(task_target.distance): Added an index on this field.

	Use the database to figure out what keys to fetch.
	* findpath.py: New file.  This file is far from ready, but can
	excercise keyfetcher.py.
	* keyfetcher.py: New file.  Fetch keys that the database indicates
	are wanted.
	* pgppathconfig.py: New file.
	* pathdb.py (_insert_key): New function.
	(insert_key): Use _insert_key to simplify code.
	(insert_key_update_tasks): New function.
	(activate_task): New function.
	(deactivate_task): New function.
	(deactivate_all_tasks): New function.
	(key_to_fetch): New function.
	(create_task): New function.
	(need_key): New function.
	* hkp.py (KEYSERVER): Moved to pgppathconfig.  All users updated.
	* createdb.sql (tasks.active, tasks.schedule): New columns.

	Fetch keys and store them into the database.
	* pathdb.py: New file.  Can enter keys into the database.
	* hkp.py: New file, that can fetch key info from a keyserver.
	* createdb.sql (key_info.key_type): Column removed.
	(tasks.finished, tasks.lastused, tasks.pathfound): New columns.
	(task_trusted, task_target, keys_needed): New tables.
